Sign-up is not available yet. An account must be provided by an admin (me).

Login with the account {email: test@gmail.com, password: 123456} to have view-only permission to the system. 
Sometimes, the Login button has to be clicked twice to work. I am not sure what is causing the problem yet.

Features on the header-bar are not implemented yet (except for the Log Out button).
Click on any tab on the left side-bar menu to view.
